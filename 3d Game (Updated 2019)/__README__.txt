Hello User!

This is a README file to explain details about the program.  All program resources are contained in this .zip file.

Software:
	-Run: Run the file named "MainMenu.java"
	-Access raw data: Open the files "_Leaderboard.store" and/or "_Settings.store" in a text editor.
		-NOTE: These files are created by the program, and won't exist until they first need to be accessed.

Settings Menu:
	-Clicking the value allows for editting.
	-The name value holds up to 3 characters.
	-Save & Exit must be clicked for updated values to be saved.

Gameplay:
	-Firing is restricted to one shot per click.
	-Whenever a target is hit, a new one is randomly generated.
	-Targets and lasers occupy 3d space, so lasers won't necessarily hit targets that the cursor is directly aimed at.
